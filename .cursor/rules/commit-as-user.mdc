# Git commits

- **Never** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` (or any Cursor/agent co-author) to commit messages.
- Commits and pushes must be authored and attributed to the repository owner only (use their Git `user.name` and `user.email`).
- When amending or rewriting commits that contain a Cursor co-author trailer, remove that trailer before pushing.
